\section{Architecture} \label{sec:arch}

The construction era DM architecture is defined in \citeds{LDM-148}.

As stated in the introduction our operational goals now include production of the data products.
In broad terms we may think if two prongs in data management: Data Production and Data Serving.
This is depicted in \figref{fig:arcorg}.

We also now have three operational data facilities for data release production and a Cloud Facility on Google for the science users.
This is all depicted in \figref{fig:simplearch}.

Details about the build up the data facilities is given in \citeds{RTN-021}.
