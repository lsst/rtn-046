\section{Data facilities and access centers} \label{sec:datafacilities}
Hardware underpins all of our operations.
This is arranged in three data facilities in US, UK and France as outlined below.
We also have two on project Data Access Centers to provide services to the scientific users.

The plan for building up the data facilities is in \citeds{RTN-021}.
A more complete list of items under may be found in the \secref{sec:products}

\subsection{USDF}
The USDF will be the main archive of Rubin data. It performs the daily processing of data including alert generation.
It performs 25\% of th DRP processing.
There is a full description in \citeds{DMTN-189}.
User batch will run at the USDF \citedsp{RTN-223}.

\subsection{FrDF}
The French Data facility will hold a copy of the Raw data.
The FRDF will run 50\% of the DRP processing.

\subsection{UKDF}
The FRDF will run 25\% of the DRP processing.

\subsection{US DAC}
The USDAC is hosted on Google Cloud.
Most image data remains at USDF but some catalogs and possibly coadds will be kept on Google.
All User files spaces and the RSP will be on google \citedsp{DMTN-209}.

\subsection{Chile DAC}

The Chilean Data Access Center will be built after operations commences.
Some discussions are still pending on its exact shape see \citeds(LDM-572}.
