\subsection{DM support in Operations} \label{sec:support}
DM is not responsible for critical systems and hence would work \emph{normal hours} which nominally would be 09:00 to 17:00 Pacific.
One may consider \emph{normal hours} in operations may be different and the DM Chile DevOps team will work Chile hours and provide early nighttime support.

We do have DM people in various timezones which may give more coverage however the range of functionality is vast and not everyone can support all of it.


\subsubsection{Out of hours - best effort}
(there will be something developer.lsst.io ?)


DM is committed to supporting the software we developed.
Most DM software, apart from Prompt Processing, is not particularly time sensitive.

There are other products build by DM such as the EFD which are critical for which an arrangement needs to be made with TSSW since it is a summit system. There is a discussion of this and other summit items in \citeds{RTN-069}.


Several of us are available out of hours and look at problems when they arise however there is no guaranteed support out of hours.
