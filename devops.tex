\section{Chile DevOps} \label{sec:devops}

The Chile DevOps team delivers and maintains the base and summit facilities (see \secref{sec:chilefacilities}).

The team provides networking and machines plus a kubernetes layer ready for deployment of services from data management as well as telescope and site software.

On the summit there are also some bare metal machines which are setup usually with puppet.

This team also controls the more classic IT support for desktops and laptop connections etc.
